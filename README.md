SIMPLE HANGMAN GAME ON PYTHON

This Python code is an implementation of the Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters of the word. The player starts with 6 lives, and each incorrect guess results in the loss of a life. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives. The current state of the guessed word and the hangman figure is displayed after each guess. The player is informed of the outcome - whether they win or lose the game. The code utilizes functions and imports external modules for the hangman word list, game logo, and hangman art stages.
